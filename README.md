# Instructions
### Starting and Preparing for a run: 
   1. Download "yargs", "fs", and "xlsx" by doing:
      * npm i yargs
      * npm i fs
      * npm i xlsx
   2. Download shutil, openpyxl, pathlib by doing:
      * pip3 install shutils
      * pip3 install openpyxl
      * pip3 install pathlib
   3. Leave the folder structure the same, as in the sars-blast.py is in the same folder as the excel file you will be analyzing, and the main.js file is in the javascript-scripts folder
      4. Keep the column structure the same as the "example.xlsx" file

# Issues:
   1. Main issue is how xlsxwriter doesn't read the xlsx file properly, make sure to edit a randomly empty cell then make it empty again and press save then rerun
